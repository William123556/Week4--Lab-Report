1. Making commits here will allow you to see which test cases will produce a bug in the code
2. It will allow anyone as a coder to be able to debug their program and improve in future versions of a program. 
3. Allows piazza staff to know what changes you made that led up to the bug.

The last index should be one less than the current length, so to fix this, we needed to add a minus one to the markdown length.

One technique I used was to just read over the program to see what it does and what each line of code is supposed to do. I just made changes incrementally until it did what I wanted. After looking at what the indexOf() method does I was able to come up with an easy and straightforward solution.

Added an if statement to check that a parenthesis directly follows the close bracket before appending to the list. 
I only used print statements at first to figure out the index where the parentheses are at.
